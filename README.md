Make sure to replace <your_access_token> with your valid access token that has the necessary Microsoft Graph API permissions to update presence, and <your_user_id> with the ID of the user whose presence you want to manage.

To obtain an access token, you'll need to register an application in Azure Active Directory and request the required permissions for the Microsoft Graph API. Once you have the access token, you can use it in the script.

Please note that you need to handle obtaining the access token securely and programmatically refreshing it when it expires. Additionally, ensure that you comply with Microsoft's policies and guidelines when using the Microsoft Graph API.
